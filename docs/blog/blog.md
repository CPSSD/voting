# Blog: MY-PROJECT-TITLE

**MY-NAME**

## My First Blog Entry

This is my first blog entry.

The blog is written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Markdown is a simple text-based mark-up language.

## My Second Blog Entry

This week, I learned how to include
[images](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images)
in my blog.

![cat](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/sblott/2017-ca400-YOUR_NAME/raw/master/docs/blog/images/cat.jpg)

Here are the instructions:

- Add the image to your repo (probably using the `images` sub-directory here).
  The cat example above is in `./images/cat.jpg`.

- Commit that and push it to your repo.

- On Gitlab, navigate to your new image and click *Raw*.  You get the raw URL of your image.  Copy that URL.

- Add your image to this document using the following format:

    <pre>![alternative text](URL)</pre>

See the example [here](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/sblott/2017-ca400-YOUR_NAME/raw/master/docs/blog/blog.md).

You can also mention other users (like me: @sblott).

## Including Code

Raw text:
```
Mary had a little lamb,
it's fleece was white as snow.
```

Syntax highlighting is also possible; for example...

Python:
```python
i = 0
while i < len(s):
   # So something.
   i = i + 1
```

Java:
```java
for (i=0; i<s.length(); i+=1) {
   // Do something.
}
```

Coffeescript:
```coffeescript
i = 0
while i < s.length
   # So something.
   i = i + 1
```

## Instructions

Once you've understood this sample, replace it with your own blog.
