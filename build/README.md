With the initial `../.gitignore`, all files placed in this directory
are ignored by git.

This is a good place to put build files.

Note, however, that while this may work well for some projects, it may not be suitable for all projects.  It depends upon the build system you're using.

You can safely remove this file:

    git rm README.md
